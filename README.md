## News App

Just a little side project I'm working on.

The basic concept _(not yet realised in this prototype)_ is that you go through the list of articles, saving them to **Read Later** _(swipe right)_ if you want to read them or discarding them _(swipe left)_ if you don't, aiming for that infamous 'Inbox zero'.

After reading a saved article, it will disappear, never to show again. Likewise, once discarded, that particular article will never show up again.

You can also read articles directly from the **Latest Feed**  but you must decide then and there if you want to save it for one more read later on. If you do not, it'll be discarded as soon as you close the article view.

### TO DO
- [ ] Fix loading time
